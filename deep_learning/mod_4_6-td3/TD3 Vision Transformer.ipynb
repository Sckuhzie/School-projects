    "### Goal of the TD\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have been introduced by [Vaswani et al. in 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) in the context of NLP (Natural Language Processing), and particulary for Machine Translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its great success has led to its adaptation to various applications, including image classification. In this trend, [Dosovitskiy et al. in 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) have proposed Vision Transformers (ViT) that we will study and implement from scratch in this TD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle is illustrated in the following picture from this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Vision Tranformers](./figures/vit.png \"Vision Transformers\")\n",
    "\n",
    "First, an input image is “cut” into sub-images equally sized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each such sub-image goes through a linear embedding. From then, each sub-image becomes a one-dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "A positional embedding is then added to these vectors (tokens). The positional embedding allows the network to know where each sub-image is positioned originally in the image. Without this information, the network would not be able to know where each such image would be placed, leading to potentially wrong predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tokens are then passed, together with a special classification token, to the transformer encoders blocks, were each is composed of : A Layer Normalization (LN), followed by a Multi-head Self Attention (MSA) and a residual connection. Then a second LN, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and again a residual connection. These blocks are connected back-to-back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a classification MLP head is used for the final classification only on the special classification token, which by the end of this process has global information about the picture.\n"

    "The transformer encoder was originally developed with sequence data in mind, such as English sentences. However, as an image is not a sequence, we need to “sequencify” an image. To do this, we break it into multiple sub-images and map each sub-image to a vector.\n",

    "We do so by simply reshaping our input, which has size (N, C, H, W), where N is the batch size, C the number of channels and (H,W) the image dimension. In the case of MNIST, dimensions are (N, 1, 28, 28). The target dimension is (N, #Patches, Patch dimensionality), where the dimensionality of a patch is adjusted accordingly.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
